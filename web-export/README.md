This directory contains the files used to export the specifications on
  http://specifications.freedesktop.org/

It's mostly 2 files:

 - `specs.idx`: information on where to fetch specific versions of different
   specifications (usually from git)

 - `update.py`: hacky script that uses specs.idx and creates html pages

To publish a new or updated spec, add an entry into `specs.idx`, and [file a
merge request](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/xdg-specs/-/merge_requests).

Once merged, the files will be automatically exported after building through
the continuous integration.
